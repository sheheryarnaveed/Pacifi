# Pacifi Frontend

- <h3><strong><i>It is highly recommended to start the backend app beofre starting the frontend app.</strong></i></h3>

## Requirements to host app locally
* The mobile app uses the following two frameworks:
  <ol>
    <li>React Native as its frontend</li>
    <li>Django as its backend</li>
  </ol>
<i>Note We need to start these apps separately. Here we describe running the frontend app locally.</i>


## Terminal Window: React
* Go to frontend File: `~/PATH-TO-Pacifi/App.js/`

* install node dependecies and node modules: `npm install`

* run the app: `expo start`
